# Dynamic Prediction in Clinical Survival Analysis (code companion)

This repository contains contains a [code companion](https://survival-lumc.github.io/DynamicPrediction-book/) (based on [Quarto](https://quarto.org/)) for the [book](https://www.routledge.com/Dynamic-Prediction-in-Clinical-Survival-Analysis/vanHouwelingen-Putter/p/book/9781439835333):

> Van Houwelingen, Hans, and Hein Putter. *Dynamic prediction in clinical survival analysis*. CRC Press, 2011.

Further notes:
- This repository effectively replaces the old website on which R code was hosted (http://www.msbi.nl/DynamicPrediction, now offline).
- The format was inspired by the nice code companion for the book *Models for Multi-State Survival Data: Rates, Risks, and Pseudo-Values* by Per Kragh Andersen and Henrik Ravn, see repository [here](https://github.com/multi-state-book/companion).

(**Note this repository is work in progress**)
