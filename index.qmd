# Preface {.unnumbered}

This is the code companion website to this book, replacing previously available materials hosted at http://www.msbi.nl/DynamicPrediction (now offline).

A chapter with errata will eventually be provided. 

## Acknowledgements {.unnumbered}

- The format was inspired by the nice code companion for the book *Models for Multi-State Survival Data: Rates, Risks, and Pseudo-Values* by Per Kragh Andersen and Henrik Ravn, see repository [here](https://github.com/multi-state-book/companion).
